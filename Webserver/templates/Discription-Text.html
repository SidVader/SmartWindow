    <h2>Description</h2>
    SmartWindow is a student project of the HAW Hamburg.</br>
    <h3>The Idea</h3>

We asked ourselfe what disturbs us while lectures. The answer was the air. Sometimes it is <i>too cold, too hot, too sticky, too humid</i>.</br>

So we asked ourselfe how could we change this. The answer was to <i>open a window</i>.</br>

The last question we asked oursefle was about the possibility to automate it. This answer was easy. <i>Yes, squire!</i></br> </br>

<i><b>A word and a blow.</b></i></br></br>

    <h3>The Concept</h3>
    The window should stay at least 5 Minutes open, expact the wind is too strong.  </br></br>

<i>Manuel</i></br>

After choosing manuel on the homepage the window could be opened and closed by the buttons on the homepage as long as the wind is calm.</br></br>

<i>Automatic</i> </br>
As standard limits the following values are used. </br>

The best temperature for working is between 20&deg;C and 26&deg;C. </br>

The best humidity for working is between 30% and 65%. </br>

The maximal limit value for air quality is 0,1 Vol. %. </br>

The maximal limit value for the wind is 20,8 m/s. </br>

The maximal limit value for the noise is 60dB.</br>
